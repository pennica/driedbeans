In 2020, Koklu and Ã–zkan published the paper cited above describing the use of a machine vision setup to extract features from images of seven different varieties of dried beans, and the use of these features in building four classifier models. They then evaluated the accuracy of those models.

In this project, I looked at the derived features dataset, and used it to build two additional models in order to compare my results to theirs.
